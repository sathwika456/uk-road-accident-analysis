 🚗 UK Road Accident Analysis

This project explores car accidents and population demographics in the United Kingdom using real-world datasets. It combines data analysis in Python, interactive D3.js visualizations, and a Tableau dashboard to draw key insights and road safety recommendations.

🧠 Key Insights

- Urban areas have higher accident rates but lower severity.
- Most accidents happen on Mondays and under poor weather/light conditions.
- Higher population density correlates with frequent but less severe accidents.



🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`)
- D3.js (interactive data visualizations)
- Tableau (dashboard building)
- Visual Studio Code Representation (to host D3.js)
